            <h3>OVERVIEW</h3>

            <p> 
                Lemurs are a group of primates that are native to the island of Madagascar. They are known for their unique and diverse characteristics, making them a fascinating and distinctive branch of the primate family.
                Lemurs are primarily found in the forests of Madagascar. They have evolved to occupy a wide range of ecological places within these forests, from those who evolved to become ground-dwellers to those who evolved to spend their time in the trees.

            <h3>PHYSICAL AND BEHAVIOURAL CHARACTERISTICS</h3>

            <p> Lemurs come in numerous different colors and patterns, but many species have large, expressive eyes and a keen sense of smell. Lemurs demonstrate a diverse set of behaviors, ranging from solitary to highly social. Some species live in family groups, while others are more solitary. They are known for their vocalizations, such as loud calls and singing, which are used for communication.</p>

            <h3>DIET</h3>

            <p> 
                Lemurs are omnivorous, with their diet consisting of fruits, leaves, flowers, nectar, insects, and small vertebrates. Their specific diet varies depending on the species and their habitat.
                For example, ring-tailed lemurs are omnivorous. They feed on a wide variety of fruits, leaves, flowers, and sometimes, they eat insects and small vertebrates. 
                While, Black-and-white ruffed lemurs are frugivorous, meaning that their diet consists mainly of fruits. These lemurs have specialized adaptations for eating fruits, such as a larger body size and strong jaws for cracking open tough fruit shells.

            <h3>PREDATORS</h3>

            <p>As for their predators, lemurs face several threats from both natural and human sources. Natural predators of lemurs in Madagascar include fossas, which are carnivorous mammals native to the island and known to prey on lemurs. Additionally, birds of prey, such as eagles and hawks, may occasionally target lemurs, especially the smaller and more vulnerable species. However, the most significant threat to lemurs today comes from human activities. Deforestation, habitat destruction, and illegal hunting by humans have driven many lemur species to the brink of extinction.</p>
